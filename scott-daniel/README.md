## Overview
This application utilizes local storage to set and retreive a JSON object and parses it to have each instance render an article.

## Getting Started
First, the user will need to draw out all the functions and map the dependencies to understand where to place certain functions, especially when async JSON methods are being used.

## Architecture
This application utilizes the jQuery, highlight.pack.js, and the Handlebars JS libraries, it also utilizes an ipsum file.
